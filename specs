-Test1-

input1: "a"
input2: "b"
output:

This test will take the simplest input ("a") and compare it to a second simple input of different values to see if they are the same value and return 0. This test is for baseline comparison

-Test1.5-

input1: "a"
input2: "a"
output: "1"

This test will take the same simple input ("a") and compare it to a second simple input of the same value to see if they are the same value and return 1. This test adds basic equality comparison.

-Test2-

input1: "ab"
input2: "ab"
output: 1

This test will take two simple values, comparing the first to the second, assigning a score of 1 for the match, and return 1 back. This test will exchange the value of a string (ab) to a number (1)

<!--This test was not needed. Succeeded without any changes
Test2

input1: "ab"
input2: "ab"
output: "ab"

This test will take a slightly more complex input ("ab"), compare it to a separate input to see if they are the same value and return that value. This test increases the complexity of the equality comparison. -->

-Test3-

input1: "ab ab"
input2: "ab"
output: 2

This is testing two words separated by a space to return an increase in the count (and out) from multiple instances of the same word. This test count the number of instances of a word in a string.

<!--This test was not needed. Succeeded without any changes
Test4

input1: "ab gg ab"
input2: "ab"
output: 2

This is testing find input2 in a string of word where some are different from input2. This test will count the instances of a word in a string and ignore parts of the string that do not match.

Possibly more test to come.
